## Description

Welcome to this e-commerce backend platform! Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, plays a significant role within the electronics industry, as it empowers businesses and consumers alike to conveniently engage in online buying and selling of electronic products. In the latest available data from 2021, the industry in the United States alone was estimated to have generated the substantial amount of US$2.54 trillion, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

## Project Purpose
E-commerce backend platform is way for an electronic store or retailer to sell products.


Key Features:
1. Functional Express.js API
2. Able to connect to a database using Sequelize
3. A development database is created and is seeded with test data
4. Enter the command to invoke the application then the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the PostgreSQL database
5. API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
6. API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia:

![In Insomnia, the user tests “GET tags,” “GET Categories,” and “GET All Products.”.](./Assets/13-orm-homework-demo-01.gif)

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia:

![In Insomnia, the user tests “GET tag by id,” “GET Category by ID,” and “GET One Product.”](./Assets/13-orm-homework-demo-02.gif)

The following animation shows the application's POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories being tested in Insomnia:

## Lessons Learned
Through working on this project, I gained a great understanding of data manipulation and API routes being tested in Insomnia Core.
